                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and Business Analytics from Indiana University Kelley School of Business, where I developed a strong foundation in both technical and business domains. My academic journey provided me with deep insights into data analysis, business intelligence, and how technology can drive strategic decision-making in corporate environments.</p>
                
                <p>During my undergraduate studies, I completed two corporate finance internships at Eaton Corporation, where I gained hands-on experience in financial analysis, reporting, and business operations. These internships taught me the importance of data-driven decision making and how enterprise systems support critical business functions across large organizations.</p>
                
                <p>Currently, I'm pursuing my Master of Science in Information Systems at Kelley, building upon my undergraduate foundation while preparing for my upcoming role as an Analyst in Eaton Corporation's Finance Leadership Development Program. This program will allow me to combine my technical expertise with financial acumen to drive process improvements and strategic initiatives.</p>
