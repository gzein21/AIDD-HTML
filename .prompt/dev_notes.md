Reflection: I used Cursor to build the scaffolding for this code, I did update a lot of the generic descriptions implemented. I uploaded my resume into the file to train the model to know my personal background. I had to remove a lot of the basic certifications and personal projects, as they did not apply to me. I have experience using HTML in S310, in which I used VScode to build it. I found cursor to go significantly more in depth, in which this required significant modification as it produced out of scope descriptions. I balanced AI Assistance with my own coding in which I removed multiple div classes and sections from the code, and rewrote some of the sections with my personal background
